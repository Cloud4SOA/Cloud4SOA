    The following two methods do nothing. For weird reason these classes
    in a service methods signature is the only way to get them included in the serialization white list.
    Usually the GWT compiler put classes in the while list if one of these condition is meet:
     1) The class is part of a GWT-RPC method signature
     2) The class is reachable navigation the properties of a class from 1)
     3) The class has the IsSerializable interface

     These classes theoretically meet 2) and 3), however they are not picked up.
     The following useless method allow them to meet 1).
